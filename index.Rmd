Hi Everyone! 

My name is Jess and I am part-time student at Columbia University working to earn my MS in Biostatistics. I also currently work full-time at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) in the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics. Details about my educational and professional experience, as well as my CV can be found [here.](about.html)

Check out this [flex dashboard](dashboard.html) that I made for the data science course I am taking using NYC Restaurant Inspections data! 

My hobbies include reading, running, and traveling (pre-COVID!) with my amazing boyfriend shown below:
